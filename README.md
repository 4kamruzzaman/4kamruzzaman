# Senior SRE Architect | Lead @ BizSafer

### Engineering Resilient Systems That Are Safe To Scale.

I operate **BizSafer**, a specialized **Production-First Engineering Lab** focused on high-availability infrastructure for platforms in **North America, the United Kingdom, and Europe**. My work is defined by industrial-grade standards and a commitment to the SRE Standard of reliability.

---

### 📊 The SRE Standard (Operational Metrics)
* **99.9% Availability Target:** Engineering zero-single-point-of-failure (ZSPoF) architectures.
* **<60s MTTR:** Implementing automated self-healing loops and disaster recovery protocols.
* **Sub-200ms Latency:** Optimizing the "Golden Path" from database to edge delivery.

### 🏗️ Technical Pillars & Lab Focus

| Pillar | Core Stack |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Infrastructure as Code** | Terraform / OpenTofu, Ansible |
| **Orchestration & Scaling** | Kubernetes (EKS, GKE, AKS), Docker |
| **Cloud & Edge Security** | AWS, GCP, Azure, Cloudflare WAF, Nginx Hardening |
| **Observability** | Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack (Four Golden Signals) |
| **Application Cores** | High-Performance Laravel, Next.js, Node.js, MySQL |
